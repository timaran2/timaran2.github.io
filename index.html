<h1>My Favorite Color</h1>

<p id="intro"> Hello, my name is Timara and my favorite color is <strong>Lavender</strong>. 
    <br>Lavender is a type of purple that is associated with a variety of meanings and provokes different feelings for people. 
        According to the article <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-purple-2795820#:~:text=Wisdom%20and%20Spirituality&text=Different%20shades%20of%20purple%20have,associated%20with%20death%20and%20mourning." target="_blank"> “Purple Color Meaning and Psychology”</a> from <em>VeryWellMind</em>,“it could represent wisdom, creativity, royalty, power, ambition, and luxury. It can also represent magic, extravagance, peace, pride, independence, and wealth”. I like the color lavender because not only is it beautiful but also promotes wellness and personally increases feelings of calmness.</p>

    Some sources state that your favorite color is also an indicator of your personality. People whose favorite color is lavender are known to have an intuitive soul and that spiritual growth tends to draw their attention. I personally resonate with these points and find them applicable to my personality traits.
